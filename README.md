# secret-number-game
A simple Python guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated secret number.
This project is a basic console game built in Python so I can practice:
- user input
- loops
- conditionals
- random number generation
- basic game logic

How the game works?
- The game chooses a random number
- The player tries to guess it.
- The game gives hints (higher/lower).
- It counts the number of attempts.
- At the end, it shows the result.

Technologies: Python 3
